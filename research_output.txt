  "topic": "Agentic Framework",
  "summary": "The Agentic Framework refers to a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of individuals as active agents in their own learning and development. It posits that learners are not passive recipients of information but rather engage in self-directed learning, making choices and taking responsibility for their educational experiences. This framework is often applied in educational settings to promote autonomy, motivation, and personal agency among students, encouraging them to set goals, reflect on their learning processes, and develop critical thinking skills.",
